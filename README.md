# clustersql [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benthor/clustersql.png)](https://travis-ci.org/benthor/clustersql) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/benthor/clustersql?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/benthor/clustersql)


Go Clustering SQL Driver - A clustering, implementation-agnostic "meta"-driver for any backend implementing "database/sql/driver".

It does (latency-based) load-balancing and error-recovery over all registered nodes.

**It is assumed that database-state is transparently replicated over all nodes by some database-side clustering solution. This driver ONLY handles the client side of such a cluster.**

All errors which are made non-fatal because of failover are logged.

To make use of clustering, use clustersql with any backend driver implementing "database/sql/driver" like so:

	import "database/sql"
	import "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
	import "github.com/benthor/clustersql"

There is currently no way around instanciating the backend driver explicitly

	mysqlDriver := mysql.MySQLDriver{}

You can perform backend-driver specific settings such as

	err := mysql.SetLogger(mylogger)

Create a new clustering driver with the backend driver

	clusterDriver := clustersql.NewDriver(mysqlDriver)

Add nodes, including driver-specific name format, in this case Go-MySQL DSN. Here, we add three nodes belonging to a [galera](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/documentation/replication-cluster-multi-master/galera/) cluster

	clusterDriver.AddNode("galera1", "user:password@tcp(dbhost1:3306)/db")
	clusterDriver.AddNode("galera2", "user:password@tcp(dbhost2:3306)/db")
	clusterDriver.AddNode("galera3", "user:password@tcp(dbhost3:3306)/db")

Make the clusterDriver available to the go sql interface under an arbitrary name

	sql.Register("myCluster", clusterDriver)

Open the registered clusterDriver with an arbitrary DSN string (not used)

	db, err := sql.Open("myCluster", "whatever")

Continue to use the sql interface as documented at http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/

## TODO
* improve test cases to actually test failover
